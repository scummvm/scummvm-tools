More on the tools can be found on our Wiki under
  http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/User_Manual/Appendix:_Tools

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a collection of various tools that may be useful to use in conjunction
with ScummVM. Please note that this module is not always in-sync with the latest
STABLE version of ScummVM.

This means that although a tool may support a feature, certain
ScummVM versions may not. ScummVM 0.6.x does not support FLAC audio, for
example.

The extraction and compression tools can either be run from the command line or
using the GUI wizard. All other tools are only available in command line.

The command line executable for the compression and extraction tools can be
invoked with the following syntax:
scummvm-tools-cli [audio params] [params] [-o output] [extract|compress] <inputfile>

This will auto-detect the tool to use depending on the input file(s). You can hint
which tool to use by specifying if you want to extract or compress data.
Alternatively you can give the name of the tool to use:
scummvm-tools-cli --tool <tool name> [audio params] [params] [-o output] <inputfile>


You can get a list of the supported tools using --list:
scummvm-tools-cli --list


[audio params] is used for compression tools to defined which audio format to
compress to. Use --mp3, --flac or --vorbis first to select a special format,
default is MP3. Then you can give additional information such as the bit rate
you want to use. Use --help to get the list of all the options you can use:
scummvm-tools-cli --help <tool name>

This will also list additional options that each tool might support.

Use the -o or --output flag to specify the output file or directory. By default
most tools will output to the directory out/ relative to the input file.

Extraction Tools:
        extract_agos
                Extracts the packed files used in the Amiga and AtariST
                versions of Elvira 1/2, Waxworks and Simon the Sorcerer 1.

                Example of usage:
                ./scummvm-tools-cli --tool extract_agos <infile 1> ... <infile n>

        extract_cge
                Unpack Soltys game data files.
                Example of usage:
                ./scummvm-tools-cli --tool extract_cge [-o outputdir] vol.dat vol.cat

        pack_cge
               Pack Soltys game data files.
               Example of usage:
                ./scummvm-tools-cli --tool pack_cge [-o outputdir] <inputdir>

        extract_cine
                Unpacks Delphine's Cinematique engine's archive files.
                Should work at least with Future Wars and Operation Stealth.
                Supports using Operation Stealth's 'vol.cnf' file as input
                in which case it will try to unpack all the archive files
                listed in 'vol.cnf'. Accepts only one input file.

                Example of usage:
                ./scummvm-tools-cli --tool extract_cine <infile>

        extract_gob_stk
                Extracts data files from STK/ITK files of Coktel Vision
                games.

                Example of usage:
                ./scummvm-tools-cli --tool extract_gob_stk [-o outputdir] <infile>

        extract_kyra
                Unpacks .PAK files from Kyrandia games.
                It is also able to extract the installer package files from
                Hand of Fate DOS floppy version. You should be sure you got
                all WESTWOOD.### files for that, since they are one big package
                file splitted into several, so with -x you will extract *all*
                files from the installer files.

                Takes some additional arguments, run extract_kyra --help for
                details.

                Example of usage:
                ./scummvm-tools-cli --tool extract_kyra -x [-o outputdir] <infile>

        extract_loom_tg16
                Extracts data files from the PC-Engine version of Loom.
                Use the dumpcd utility at http://www.zeograd.com/misc_download.php
                to dump the code tracks on the CD.

                Example of usage:
                ./scummvm-tools-cli --tool extract_loom_tg16 [-o outputdir] <infile>

        extract_mm_apple
                Extracts data files from the Apple II version of Maniac
                Mansion.

                Example of usage:
                ./scummvm-tools-cli --tool extract_mm_apple [-o outputdir] <disk1.dsk> <disk2.dsk>

        extract_mm_c64
                Extracts data files from the Commodore 64 version of Maniac
                Mansion.

                Example of usage:
                ./scummvm-tools-cli --tool extract_mm_apple [-o outputdir] <disk1.d64> <disk2.d64>

        extract_mm_nes
                Extracts data files from the NES version of Maniac Mansion.
                Japanese version is _not_ supported.

                Example of usage:
                ./scummvm-tools-cli --tool extract_mm_nes [-o outputdir] <infile.PRG>

        extract_parallaction
                Extracts the contents of archives used by Nippon Safes

                Example of usage:
                ./scummvm-tools-cli --tool extract_parallaction [--small] [-o outputdir] <infile>

        extract_scumm_mac
                Extracts Macintosh "single file" SCUMM games into their
                component parts, for use with ScummVM.
                This is required for ScummVM up to version 0.6.x; all
                later versions directly support reading this file
                format.

                Example of usage:
                ./scummvm-tools-cli --tool extract_scumm_mac [-o outputdir] <infile>

        extract_zak_c64
                Extracts data files from the Commodore 64 version of Zak
                McKracken.

                Example of usage:
                ./scummvm-tools-cli --tool extract_zak_c64 [-o outputdir] <disk1.d64> <disk2.d64>

Compression Tools:
        compress_agos
                Used to compress the Feeble Files or Simon the Sorcerer 1/2
                voc/wav files to MP3, Vorbis or FLAC.

                Example of usage:
                ./scummvm-tools-cli --tool compress_agos --vorbis -q 7 SIMON2.WAV

                Specify --mac for the mac version (obviously).
                Default output is input with changed extension.

        compress_gob
                Compresses Gobliiins! data files.

        compress_kyra
                Used to compress The Legend of Kyrandia, The Legend of
                Kyrandia: Hand of Fate and The Legend of Kyrandia: Malcolm's
                Revenge, Lands of Lore: The Throne of Chaos audio files with
                MP3, Vorbis or FLAC.

                Examples of usage:
                ./scummvm-tools-cli --tool compress_kyra <flags here> input/GEMCUT.VRM

                Note: You have to keep the file extension the tool will append
                else it will NOT work. Use it as shown above, copy all speech
                files to a directory and let the tool put the output file in
                another directory.

        compress_queen
                Used to rebuild the datafile of Flight of the Amazon Queen,
                and allow optional MP3, Vorbis or FLAC compression.

                Example of usage:
                ./scummvm-tools-cli --tool compress_queen [mode params] [-o outputfile] queen.1

                Default output file is "queen.1c"

        compress_saga
                Used to compress SAGA engine digital sound files to MP3, Vorbis
                or FLAC.

                Example of usage:
                ./scummvm-tools-cli --tool compress_saga [mode params] [-o outputfile] <infile>

                Where <file> is the sound file you with to compress, without the
                extension.
                Default output file is input file with the extensions ".cmp"

                For Inherit the Earth, the digital music (music.rsc), speech
                (voices.rsc or "inherit the earth voices") and sound effects
                (sounds.rsc) files can be compressed. For I have no mouth, the
                speech (voices*.res) files can be compressed.

                The compressed files have the ".cmp" extension. Once compressed,
                you only need the respective .cmp files.

                There is no compression support yet for the following versions:
                - The Mac CD Guild version of Inherit the Earth (uses MacBinary
                  *.bin files)
                - The unsupported early DOS demo of Inherit the Earth

        compress_sci
                Used to compress Sierra resource.aud/.sfx and AUDIO001.002
                audio files with MP3, Vorbis or FLAC. This tool is NOT
                compatible with the newer SCI32 games yet.

                Example of usage:
                ./scummvm-tools-cli --tool compress_sci [mode params] -o outputfile <infile>

                The name of the output file is required. Use a temporary name,
                and after the tool finishes compressing it, replace the original
                uncompressed file with the compressed one. So, if for example
                your original audio resource file is resource.aud, you can use
                a temporary name like resource.tmp. Then, move the original
                resource.aud file elsewhere and rename resource.tmp to
                resource.aud.

        compress_scumm_bun
                Used to compress '.bun' music/voice files with MP3, Vorbis
                or FLAC.

                Example of usage:
                ./scummvm-tools-cli --tool compress_scumm_bun [mode params] [-o outputfile] <infile>

                Default outputfile is inputfile with the extension ".bun"

                Please note that FLAC compression will produce larger files
                than the original, for The Curse of Monkey Island!

        compress_scumm_san
                Compresses '.san' smush animation files. It uses lossless
                zlib for compressing FOBJ gfx chunks inside a san file.
                It also can create a separate Ogg file with the audio track.

                Example of usage:
                ./scummvm-tools-cli --tool compress_scumm_san [mode params] [-o outputfile] <infile>

                Default output is inputfile with the extension ".san"

                In order to use such compressed files, your ScummVM binary
                must have been built with zlib support enabled (you can find
                out whether that's the case by looking at the About dialog).
                For the Ogg or MP3 compression feature, your ScummVM binary
                naturally must have been built with Ogg or MP3 support enabled.

                NOTE: For some '.san' files there is a corresponding '.flu'
                file, which contains offsets into the '.san' file. Hence, the
                compress_scumm_san has to modify the '.flu' file. This happens
                automatically, if the '.san' and '.flu' files are in the
                same directory (which is normally the case). If you want to
                move the '.san' files before compressing them, make sure to
                move the '.flu' files, too!

        compress_scumm_sou
                Used to compress .sou files to .so3 (MP3), .sog (Vorbis),
                or .sof (FLAC).

                Example of usage:
                ./scummvm-tools-cli --tool compress_scumm_sou [mode params] [-o outpufile] <infile>
                ./scummvm-tools-cli --mp3 MONSTER.SOU

                Default output file is inputfile with changed extensions,
                depends on the compression method used.

        compress_sword1
                Used to compress Broken Sword 1's music and speech .clu files
                to .cl3 (MP3), .clg (Vorbis) or .clf (FLAC). Only the PC and
                the Mac version are currently supported. The PSX version is not
                supported by this tool.

                Example of usage:
                ./scummvm-tools-cli --tool compress_sword1 --vorbis -q 7 BS1/swordres.rif

        compress_sword2
                Used to compress Broken Sword 2's music and speech .clu
                files to .cl3 (MP3), .clg (Vorbis) or .clf (FLAC).

                Please note that FLAC compression will produce a larger file
                than the original! This is because the original files already
                use lossy compression.

                Example of usage:
                ./scummvm-tools-cli --tool compress_sword2 [params] <file>

        compress_tinsel
                Used to compress tinsel .smp files.

        compress_touche
                Used to compress and pack Touche speech files ('Vxxx' and
                'OBJ') to MP3, Vorbis or FLAC to a single file named
                TOUCHE.SO3 (MP3), TOUCHE.SOG (Vorbis), or TOUCHE.SOF (FLAC).

                Once compressed, only TOUCHE.DAT and TOUCHE.SOx files are
                required to play the game under ScummVM.

                Example of usage:
                ./scummvm-tools-cli --tool compress_touche [mode params] [-o outputfile] <inputdir>

                Default outpufile is TOUCHE.* (depends on compression method).
                Files in the input folder should be in uppercase.

        compress_tucker
                Used to compress sound and speech files from AUDIO/FX/MUSIC/SPEECH
                directories to a single file named TUCKER.SO3 (MP3), TUCKER.SOG
                (Vorbis) or TUCKER.SOF (FLAC).

                Once compressed, the four directories are not required to play
                the game under ScummVM.

                Example of usage:
                ./scummvm-tools-cli --tool compress_tucker [mode params] [-o outputfile] <inputdir>

                Default outpufile is TUCKER.SOx (depends on compression method).
                Files in the input folder should be in uppercase.

Script Tools:
        decine
                Decompiles Delphine's Cinematique engine's scripts.
                Should work at least with Future Wars and Operation Stealth.

                Example of usage:
                decine [type] [version] [filename]
                type: -prc or -rel (Use -prc for *.prc-files, -rel for *.rel-files)
                version: -v1 or -v2 (Use -v1 for Future Wars, -v2 for Operation Stealth)
                filename: The name of the script file to decode

        degob
                Decompiles TOT scripts used in Coktel Vision games

                Example of usage:
                degob <version> <file.tot> [<file.ext>] [<commun.ext>]

                "<version>" describes from which game the script file
                was taken and is one of "Gob1", "Gob2", "Gob3", "Ween",
                "Bargon", "Fascination, "Lost", "Woodruff", "Dynasty"
                and "Urban".

                If the script file calls loadMult(), the script file's
                EXT file must be supplied on the command line as well;
                some script files also require a commun.ext. degob throws
                an error to let you know if any of the two should be the
                case.

        dekyra
                Basic script disassembler for Legend of Kyrandia games

        descumm
                Decompiles SCUMM scripts

        desword2
                Disassembles Broken Sword II scripts


Encoder Tools:
        encode_dxa [params] <file>

                Creates DXA file out of extracted Smacker video.

                To extract a video use RAD Game Tools and perform 2 passes
                on it. For example, if your video is called 'intro.smk'.

                1. Extract the video to PNG, 256 colors (choose PNG format
                and tick the checkbox). It will create bunch of files named
                'introXXX.png', where XXX is frame number. Make sure you have
                extracted 256 colors PNGs, otherwise encode_dxa will complain.

                2. Extract the audio to WAV format, you will get an
                'intro.wav' file.

                3. Put files 'intro.smk', 'intro.wav' and 'intro*.png' into a
                single directory.

                4. Run `encode_dxa intro.smk` in that directory

                5. You will get an intro.dxa file and intro.flac/mp3/ogg file
                in result.

                Additionally you may use batch processing mode of SMK files in
                RAD Game Tools. Just select more than one file and push the
                'Convert' button. It will ask you either you want them
                processed in batch mode and will do this for you. All buttons
                and conversion options work the same.

        convert_dxa.bat
        convert_dxa_one.bat

                To ease your life we also provide batch files to autoconvert
                all files. It should work with any game version.

                1. Copy *.smk files from all CDs to some directory

                2. Edit paths in convert_dxa.bat file.

                3. Run the batch. If you set everything correct, it will be
                almost unattended conversion, just for several files there
                are no audio, and RAD Game Tools converter will ask you to
                press OK

        convert_dxa.sh

                Same as above convert_dxa.bat, just for *nix-based systems.
                It uses Wine to run RAD Game Tools.
