\section{Current restrictions}
This section describes restrictions and limitations that are currently placed on the individual engines that have been implemented.

\subsection{SCUMMv6}
roomObj scripts have a header specifying offsets for various verbs. This is currently ignored, and the script is treated as a single piece of code; it would be more appropriate to create functions from these and properly treat stopObjectCodeA/B as returns.

\subsection{KYRA2}
The decompiler has only been tested with English scripts (.EMC files) from the Kyra 2 demo. It is possible that some scripts from the full version misbehave somehow; as I do not own the game, I cannot be sure of this.

Only "regular" scripts are supported; animation scripts are not supported. It looks like the file names of animation scripts all start with either \_Z or \_IDL, but this is not necessarily an exhaustive list.
